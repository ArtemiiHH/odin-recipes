    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Pelmeni are traditional Russian dumplings made from thin dough filled with
      seasoned ground meat, usually a mix of pork and beef. Theyâ€™re small,
      bite-sized pockets that are boiled until tender and often served hot with
      sour cream, butter, or vinegar. Pelmeni are loved for their simple,
      comforting taste and are a staple in Russian cuisine, perfect as a hearty
      meal or snack.
